First we start with the Poisson equation in one dimension, which it is in fact an ODE. We considder the equation $-u''(x)=f(x)$ for $x \in (0,1)$ and $u(0)=u(1)=0$.
The goal here is to use the finite element method to solve the problem.

We will uniformly partition the interval $(0,1)$, each of size $h :=\frac{1}{M+1}$, where $M$ is the number of partitions specified by the user. The idea for solving problem of this type is to transform the ODE/PDE problem to a matrix equation of the form $A \xi=b$ where $\xi$ is the unkown and $A$ and $b$ can be determined from the problem. To see the mathematical details of how to set up the variational problem and obtain the matrix $A$, see chapters $1.1-1.2$ of the reference book for this project.
